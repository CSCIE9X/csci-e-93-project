Total of 100 (problem set) + 35 (final project) Points

Please submit your solution to this problem set using "git" with the tag
ps6-submit.

For this assignment, based on your architecture design from Problem
Set 2 with appropriate modifications made by you based on comments and
design changes, and with your solution to Problem Set 5 (the emulator
for your architecture design), complete the following assignment.

1. (100 Points counted toward the grade for problem sets) Produce a
   detailed description of the actions taken by your processor on each
   processor cycle and for each edge of each clock phase.  Your
   description should include the conditions under which the action is
   taken -- for example, only when a particular instruction is present
   in the IR (Instruction Register) or only when the condition code
   produced by the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) indicates a zero
   result.  This complete description is tantamount to a description
   of the microcode for your processor should your design be
   microcoded.

2. (35 Points counted toward the grade for the final project not
   toward the grade for problem sets) Write VHDL code to interact with
   the memory subsystem to read and write a 16-bit word.  Your VHDL
   code should be an implementation of a finite state machine or FSM
   (or, if you prefer, an FSM invoked from another FSM) executing in
   the Altera DE2-70 or DE2-115 FPGA.  It should read a word from
   location 0x1dea and then write the value that was read into
   location 0x0b0e.  Both the read and the write should be issued in
   16-bit mode.  After completing the write, the FSM should begin the
   same process again without termination.  This code will serve as
   your memory interface in the final project.

   Use pushbutton KEY3 on the DE2-70 or DE2-115 board to serve as the
   mem_reset line to the memory subsystem.

   Use slide switch SW17 on the DE2-70 or DE2-115 board to serve as
   the mem_suspend line to the memory subsystem.

   Your VHDL code should use the clocks generated by the memory
   subsystem -- they are named sysclk1 and sysclk2 -- as the clocks
   for all logic on the DE2-70 or DE2-115 board.

   Use slide switch SW16 on the DE2-70 or DE2-115 board to serve as
   the clock_hold line to the memory subsystem.

   Use pushbutton KEY2 on the DE2-70 or DE2-115 board to serve as the
   clock_step line to the memory subsystem.

Please include with this assignment an up-to-date copy of your
processor's block diagram and an up-to-date copy of your processor's
instruction set.
